The development of an innovative tomato irrigation system, named IrrigaTom,
addresses the challenges posed by post-harvest rice paddy fields left unused for
extended periods. With a focus on sustainable food and agriculture, this system
leverages IoT technology to provide efficient watering solutions for tomato cultivation.
By integrating drip irrigation controlled via smartphone applications, the IrrigaTom
system offers scheduled watering, controlled irrigation, and real-time soil moisture
monitoring, optimizing water resources and enhancing crop yields. Moreover, the
incorporation of solar panels enhances sustainability and reduces operational costs,
aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Future recommendations
emphasize community engagement, ongoing research for system improvement, policy
advocacy, robust monitoring, and capacity building initiatives to ensure the system's
effectiveness and contribution to SDGs for Sustainable Food & Agriculture. Through
these measures, IrrigaTom emerges as a pivotal solution in sustainable agriculture,
fostering environmental stewardship and societal well-being
